            <p>Hey there! I'm Tom, currently pursing a <em>BSc in Computer Science</em> at <b>Royal Holloway, University of London.</b></p>
            <p>Before that, I was a professional musician. I'm a little rusty compared to what I used to be, but I still love music and try to practice drums
            every day.</p>
            <p>
                In my spare time I like rock-climbing, running, and making electronic music. I drink too much coffee and love a good book.</p>
